## Map project

This project will map some of my favorite restaurants on a map using leaflet and R Markdown. The project will be posted on GitHub.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(leaflet)

```

## Producing the map

I used Google Maps to obtain longitude and latitude information for a few of my favorite restaurants, and created a data frame with that information.

```{r create data frame}

restmap <- data.frame(name = c("Montage","Cottonwood Canyon", "Masala","Tapatio"),
      lat = c(42.536389200476265,42.534515563548176, 42.51697428665051, 42.706651294018855),
      lng = c(-92.44527667359372,-92.44704156713055, -92.45633751311594, -92.47644602348785))

```

The next code chunck generates the map and adds a pop-up with the restaurant name to the markers.

```{r make the map}
restmap %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(popup = restmap$name)
```
